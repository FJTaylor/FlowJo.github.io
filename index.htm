<p>The FlowJo Exchange is a repository that allows users to upload annotated scripts and download shared scripts. Plugins are a new addition to the Exchange that allow users to create their own extended functionality for the FlowJo application. The open plugin architecture of 10.1r7 allows FlowJo users access to cutting-edge tools that can be integrated into their current FlowJo analysis workflows, so any tool can be integrated into FlowJo.</p>

<p>Don't worry, we are pretty obsessive about documentation. Each script, plugin, or visualization we provide includes instructions that step you through how to use it, and we urge others who post to do the same. No JavaScript, HTML, or black belt skills are required.</p>

Plugins (NEW)</h2><p>Yea, we can cluster that.  If you have an algorithm or application that needs to do something upon opening or saving OR you would like exported population data and user-specified parameters passed to your application, we can do that.  In fact, we can bring the clusters back into FlowJo so everyone can use what you have written.  To learn more, please see our FlowJo for developers page (coming soon). </p><h3>

<p>FlowJo's script editor is integrated directly into the core of FlowJo, and gives real-time access to all statistics, gates, groups, and metadata for use in creating custom analysis tools within FlowJo.  This allows a user to write code that will be executed within the program using Java script OR for a biologist to drop some of the scripts hosted here into FlowJo to help with their particular application (e.g. index sorting).  </p>

<p>Scripts produced in the Script editor can be saved as text files, shared, and run by anyone in three clicks by loading them into a FlowJo workspace and clicking <strong>“Run”</strong>. </p>

<p><em>Available Scripts:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/FlowJo-LLC/indexed-sorting">Indexed Sorting</a>: Compiles index sorting keywords and creates a gate for each cell, with the well location as the name.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/FlowJo-LLC/Basic-Loop">Basic Loop</a>: Basic loop tool in Java Script to initialize a new project from.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/FlowJo-LLC/Collection-order-sort">Collection Order Sort</a>: Creates a sortable keyword based on day, month, year metadata.  </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/FlowJo-LLC/ControlBasedInclusionGating">Control Based Inclusion Gating</a>: Automatically creates "positive gates" using control samples' properties</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/FlowJo-LLC/Relative-gate">Relative Gate</a>:  Create a gate relative to a pre-defined (negative) population</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some of us spend our weekend playing with visualizations (yes, seriously) and we'll post some here with some instructions for use. </p>
